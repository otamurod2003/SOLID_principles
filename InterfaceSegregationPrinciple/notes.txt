The Interface Segregation Principle states that 

	"Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use. 

	Rather than one fat interface, 
	numerous little interfaces are preferred 
	based on groups of methods 
	with each interface serving one submodule".

//good example: 

public class HPLaserJetPrinter : IPrinterTasks, IFaxTasks, IPrintDuplexTasks ...
